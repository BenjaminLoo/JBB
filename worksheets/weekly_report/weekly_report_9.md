This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

-   Worked on the result viewer tables

## What do I plan to do next week

-   Formatting the code and the functions such that it will be easier to read
-   Start working on the graph that can render the results based on the values from the result viewer.

## Additional Thoughts
